== Couchbase Spark Connector 3.2.2 GA (July 2022)

Version 3.2.2 is the third version to support Spark 3.2.x and is built on top of the Couchbase Scala SDK 1.3.x as well
as the Java DCP Client.

*Features*
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-157[SPARKC-157^]: Add support for "ignore" variants for KeyValue insert, replace and remove operations. This has been available in the Spark Connector 2.x series and has not been ported forward until this point.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-159[SPARKC-159^]: TLS configuration is now more flexible. TLS can be enabled trough couchbases:// in the connection string, as well as being more robust in accepting certail security config parameters.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-160[SPARKC-160^]: To avoid classpath issues in the Databricks notebook environment, the
Reactor library is now shaded in the assembly jar that is available for download. The regular jar still has the unshaded version of Reactor.

*Bug fixes and stability*
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-158[SPARKC-158^]: Open the implicitBucket if set for cluster-level operations. This
makes sure that cluster-level operations like N1QL queries can be performed against Couchbase Server clusters pre 6.5.

== Couchbase Spark Connector 3.2.1 GA (May 2022)

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-96[SPARKC-96^]:
Provide more fault-tolerant batch mutations.
`saveToCouchbase` now takes a `maxConcurrent` parameter, giving the application control over the size of batches that will be written, from each executor.

*Bug fixes and stability*

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-85[SPARCK-85^]: Raise N1QL errors as exceptions rather than logging them.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/SPARKC-82[SPARKC-82^]:
When running a N1QLQuery, if multiple buckets have been specified, then the bucket to use must now be explicitly chosen.
E.g. `sc.couchbaseQuery(query, bucketName = "default")`.  This is safer than choosing an arbitrary bucket.
